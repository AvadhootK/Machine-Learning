# Machine Learning Projects
## 1) Bank Customer Stay Prediction
- An Artificial neural network is created and trained to predict whether the customer should stay with the bank or leave based on the given historical data.
- Accuracy of ANN is 86.1%.
## 2) Breast Cancer Detection
- Logistic Regression model is trained to detect breast cancer.
- Accuracy of the model is 96.87%.
## 3) Iris Dataset Analysis - Classification
