# Machine Learning Projects

A collection of end-to-end machine learning projects built using Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and NLP libraries, covering applications in classification, regression, image recognition, and natural language processing.


## 1. Bank Customer Churn Prediction

- Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank based on their historical records (e.g., tenure, credit score, balance).
- Achieved an accuracy of 86% on the test set.
- **Technologies:** Python, Keras, Pandas, scikit-learn


## 2. Breast Cancer Detection

- Implemented a Logistic Regression model to classify tumors as malignant or benign using diagnostic features from the UCI Breast Cancer dataset.
- Model achieved a high accuracy of 96.87%.
- **Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn


## 3. Image Classification – Cats vs. Dogs

- Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs.
- Used data augmentation and dropout for better generalization.
- **Technologies:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, CNNs
