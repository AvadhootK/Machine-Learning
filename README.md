# Machine Learning Projects
## 1) Bank Customer Stay Prediction
- Built and trained an artificial neural network to predict whether the customer should stay with the bank or leave based on the given historical data.
- Accuracy of ANN : 86.1%.
## 2) Breast Cancer Detection
- Logistic Regression model is trained to detect breast cancer.
- Accuracy of the model : 96.87%.
## 3) Image Recognition - Cats and Dogs
- Built and trained a convolutional neural network to identify whether the image is of cat or a dog. 
## 4) Iris Dataset Analysis - Classification
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Iris flower dataset.
- Classification of flower species is done using following algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression (Accuracy : 97.77%)
2. K-nearest neighbours (Accuracy : 97.77%)
3. Decision Trees (Accuracy : 97.77%)
## 5) Sentiment analysis
- Customer reviews of resturants are predicted as 'good review' or 'bad review' using natural language processing.
- Accuracy of the model : 72%.
